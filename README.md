# synthpop
Python implementation of the [R package synthpop](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/synthpop/index.html).

The R implementation of synthpop is a tool for producing synthetic versions of microdata containing confidential information so that they are safe to be released to users for exploratory analysis. The key objective of generating synthetic data is to replace sensitive original values with synthetic ones causing minimal distortion of the statistical information contained in the dataset. Variables, which can be categorical or continuous, are synthesised one-by-one using sequential modelling. Replacements are generated by drawing from conditional distributions fitted to the original data using parametric or classification and regression trees models.

This is a reimplementation in Python which allows synthetic data to be generated via the method `.generate()` after the algorithm had been fit to the original data via the method `.fit()`. The process can be largely automated, if default settings are used, or with methods defined by the user. Optional parameters can be used to influence the disclosure risk and the analytical quality of the synthetic data.


### Development status and roadmap
This project is in Alpha status and the roadmap can be found [here](https://github.com/hazy/synthpop/blob/master/ROADMAP.md).

## Installation

### pip

```bash
pip install py-synthpop
```

### Source

```bash
git clone git@github.com:hazy/synthpop.git
cd synthpop
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py install
```

## Examples


### Adult dataset
We will use the [US adult census dataset](https://github.com/hazy/synthpop/blob/master/datasets/README.md), which is a freely available open dataset extracted from the US census bureau database. The dataset is initially designed for a binary classification problem and the task is to predict whether a person earns over $50,000 a year. The dataset is a mixture of discrete and continuous features, including age, working status (workclass), education, marital status, race, sex, relationship and hours worked per week.

### synthpop

1. Use default parameters for the Adult dataset:

```Python
In [1]: from synthpop import Synthpop
